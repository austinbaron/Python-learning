### Data-types

There are different types of data types in Python. Some built-in Python data types are:
* Numeric data types: int, float, complex
* String data types: str
* Sequence types: list, tuple, range
* Binary types: bytes, bytearray
* Mapping data type: dict
* Boolean type: bool
* Set data types: set, frozenset

#### Numeric Data type

* int - holds signed integers of non-limited length.
* float- holds floating precision numbers and it’s accurate up to 15 decimal places.
* complex- holds complex numbers.

#### String Data type

The string is a sequence of characters. Python supports Unicode characters. Generally, strings are represented by either single or double-quotes

#### List Data type

The list is a versatile data type exclusive in Python.It can simultaneously hold different types of data. 

```python
a= [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(a)

```

#### Tuple

The tuple is another data type which is a sequence of data similar to a list. But it is immutable. That means data in a tuple is write-protected. Data in a tuple is written using parenthesis and commas.

#### Dictionary

Python Dictionary is an unordered sequence of data of key-value pair form. It is similar to the hash table type. Dictionaries are written within curly braces in the form key:value. It is very useful to retrieve data in an optimized way among a large amount of data.
